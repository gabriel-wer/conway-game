# GAME OF LIFE

### ABOUT
Based on the Conway game of life model [LINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

### RULES
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

### NOTES
The cells are generated automagically using randomInts (0, 1)
